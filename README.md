# Intro ML
Intro ML, is an introductory project to machine learning using python, so you can get to know, the very basics of machine learning, and interact with them.
There are three main files, one with static vectors, one uses a dataset from files and the last one uses different classifier,you can play with any of them, try the examples with new data of your own, use different classifiers ...etc
